        <b>Who is the person behind this page?</b> Well, let me tell you. A
        relentless self-starter who only ever gives his very best effort and
        nothing less. A person who understands that a team is a sum of its
        parts, and that success is never the product of one person alone. A
        person that appreciates the necessity of understanding and fitting into
        different cultures, having called several different countries and
        organizations home over the years. A person that understands the
        opportunities, but more importantly the limitations, of emerging
        technologies. A person that chooses to use failure as a learning
        experience rather than as a defeat. This is who I am and what I have to
        offer.
