        Predicting Recessions with Machine Learning
      </h5>
      <p>
        Until recently, logit and probit models have been the gold standard for
        econometric analysis. However, we are now living in a world of big data,
        so it begs the question whether our forecasting methodologies should be
        updated as well to reflect this new reality. This thesis conducts a
        horse race to determine whether machine learning models outperform
        traditional logistic regression models. By using a novel ranking and
        bootstrapped AUROC scores, the analysis provides further evidence that
        machine learning models are better at predicting recessions than
        traditional logistic models.

        This paper conducts a comprehensive horse race between several popular
        machine learning models and compares their performances with a
        traditional logistic regression model at predicting US recessions. Each
        model is tested at three-, six-, nine-, 12-, and 18-month horizons. A
        gradient boosting, random forest, support vector classifier, feedforward
        neural network, and custom consensus model are all compared against the
        logistic regression model. A dataset spanning 1962-2023 using six
        leading indicators is used for training and testing the models. The
        predictive ability of each model is evaluated using two scoring
        methodologies. The first scoring methodology is a novel ranking system
        using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and AUROC scores. The second
        scoring methodology uses bootstrapped AUROC scores to perform a
        one-sided test on every model pair across each horizon. The results
        strongly suggest the gradient boosting, random forest and consensus
        models are generally superior at recession classification across
        horizons in comparison to the logistic regression model. The evidence
        for outperforming the logistic regression model is significantly weaker
        for the neural network and support vector classifier models. Finally,
        based on the findings of the consensus model, the results indicate
        combining the predictions of multiple models can produce better
        recession predictions than relying on the outputs of a single model.
